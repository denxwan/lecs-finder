# Lectures Finder - *Released Version V1.0 (BETA)*

## 🙋🏻 Introduction

Hi ! This is a project by someone who hated checking on-going other lecture sessions in the provided "HTML-y" timetable from the academics. Hope you're here because of it too. God I wish if there is a easy way of doing it.

**Fear not.** Solution is here.

# ✨ https://lectures-finder.netlify.app ✨

**Lectures Finder** is a web-application which allows users *(Y2S1-2022JUL)* to completely overview the lecture schedule at ease. Especially need to mention that **this is not a timetable app**, it's more like a "easy-way" to see other sessions that you can join if you missed any 😉.
